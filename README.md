# TGM-ACC-2019
My Solution for the TGM Advent Coding Contest 2019.

## Run
To get results either:
 - run the `main.py` in the root directory and enter the number of the level you want to execute:
 
 ```
 the/repository/location> python main.py
 Level: 0
 The output of the level
 ```
 
 - execute the `main.py` in the level folder from the root folder of this repository:
 
 ```
 the/repository/location> python level0/main.py
 The output of the level
 ```
 
The results will then be written to the `.out` files in the level directory with the same name as there corresponding `.in` files (e.g. `example.in` -> `example.out`).
